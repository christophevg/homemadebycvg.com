    title: The Virtue of Technology Agnosticism
    description: |
      When I tell people that I am technology agnostic, they open their eyes a
      little bit more. Usually something along the lines of: ‚ÄúBut Christophe,
      you‚Äôve been programming longer than I‚Äôve been alive, you have more
      hardware devices in your home than I‚Äôve ever heard of, and your personal
      software development library contains books older than some papyrus in
      the museum of ancient history. How on earth can you, of all people, be
      technology agnostic?‚Äù  
      And, you know, the problem is, they are right, in a way.

      My son, like many sons (and daughters) loves Minecraft. He especially
      likes the Enderman. When he wanted to use the character as a base for a
      school project, but couldn‚Äôt find a model to start from, we started
      brainstorming.

      (understandably) "_free instances will spin down with inactivity, which
      can delay requests by 50 seconds or more._". Their [web service
      pricing](https://render.com/pricing#compute) is more than reasonable, yet
      coughing up $7/month for each single little Flask app is a bit too much.
      So, with Hosted Flasks I can simply bring them all together on a single
      web service, which doesn't spin down.
