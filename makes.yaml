      I have [several small Flask apps](https://apps.homemadebycvg.com), which
      don't use a lot of resources. For some time I'm enjoying the hosting
      services of [Render](https://render.com). Their free tier is great, but
      (understandably) "_free instances will spin down with inactivity, which
      can delay requests by 50 seconds or more._". Their [web service
      pricing](https://render.com/pricing#compute) is more than reasonable, yet
      coughing up $7/month for each single little Flask app is a bit too much.
      So, with Hosted Flasks I can simply bring them all together on a single
      web service, which doesn't spin down.
